# BrainfuckInterpreter
My own brainfuck interpreter written in C

# Specs
Operate on a 30000 Bytes tab.
Can only accept up to 30000 imbricated while loops.
Output on standart output FD 1.

# Why
I did this first interpreter in about an hour to start to better undestand Brainfuck, and try to do myself an interpreter, which was not really hard to implement.
My next step in the world of intrepretation and compilation will be to try to understand how could work and implement a Brainfuck to ARM ASM compiler in C.
